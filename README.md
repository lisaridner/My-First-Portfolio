Challenge Two - Building a Deployed Portfolio of Work Samples

I created a web page to display my work, hobbies, background and contact info to prospective employers to look at. I added my picture to the header. Added navigational links to each section on my page. Made four different sections to provide requested information. My work - section has pictures and titles of work samples. I provided a link to my Git Hub to show my first application that I've done in my bootcamp program. I have mafe this application image larger in size than the others. I have a placeholder for future projects that I will include. I have added responsive code and alternative text for my website.  



I worked withe a tutor on my profile picture, and the four sections of my pages. They also helped wiht setting up a card container for my images in My Work section.

I worked with a TA on lining my pictures up in the work section of the site.
